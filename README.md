# squinchwerms

Game where you are a worm and you jump around and stuff

## Plan

- [ ] Making moving around. WASD to control head and arrow keys to control end.
      The two are connected by segments with some elasticity.
- [ ] Procedurally generate a mesh based on nearby terriain nodes with marching
      squares.
- [ ] Allow eating dirt with head, which fills up dirt meter. Excrete dirt with
      other end.
